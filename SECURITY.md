## Supported Versions

The website is usually updated on its own, and doesn't require you to update anything. If for some reason you're on an old version, this page will tell you if it's still supported (probably not).

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 2.1.1   | :white_check_mark: |
| 2.1.0   | :x:                |
| 2.0.x   | :x:                |
| 1.x.x   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Let us know in the discussions. That's where we're going to check for issues. :smiley:

## Fixing Something Yourself

You are free to fix something yourself with a pull request. We will only accept changes that fix bugs only.
