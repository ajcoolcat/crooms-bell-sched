        <h2>Consequences for violating our Terms.</h2>
        <p>
            We will take action against violations of our Terms the first time we see it. We also accept anonymous tips.
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dt>First Offense</dt>
            <dd>
                This will only be a warning, unless the act is too severe. If so, we may just skip to Second or Third
                Offense.
            </dd>
            <dt>Second Offense</dt>
            <dd>
                This will be a temporary account suspension, usually for only a day, but may be longer depending on the
                offense.
            </dd>
            <dt>Third Offense</dt>
            <dd>
                This will be an extended account suspension or termination. If administration deems it necessary, there
                may be system-wide bans or lockdowns.
            </dd>
        </dl>
