        <p>
            We currently have a <strong class="important">Hurricane Watch</strong> in effect. This means that hurricane
            conditions are possible within the next 2 days. It's likely that we'll get a
            <strong class="urgent">Hurricane Warning</strong> overnight.

                <p>
                    Due to the anticipated impact of Hurricane Milton in our area, all schools will follow a regular
                    <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">early dismissal</strong> schedule on Tuesday, Oct. 8,
                    2024, and all field trips, after school activities, events, facility rentals, and childcare services
                    including KidZone & Beyond and 21st Century Learning programs will be canceled.

                <p>All SCPS schools will be <strong>closed</strong> Wednesday and Thursday, October 9-10th.</p>
                <p>
                    We will make a determination about whether we can have school on Friday once we are able to assess
                    the communityâ€™s need for shelters and any potential damage to our campuses.
                    We will provide that information on Thursday.
                </p>

                    The Daily Poll will happen as scheduled for the rest of the week. Make sure you do it or else.
